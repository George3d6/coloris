# Coloris

Coloris is a color picker I created for a website of mine.

It allows the user to chose between a few dozen (or hundreds) of colors in a quick and mobile friendly way.

Coloris is very small, standing in at 5.085KB uncompressed. It's easy to customize
and insert into your project (only a single script tag required).


I was based on [this codepen by Lewi Hussey](https://codepen.io/Lewitje/pen/zqVaPY). However, the original used a lot of Jquery and was quite inefficient and hard to read (for my taste, at any rate). So I decided to improve on it.
